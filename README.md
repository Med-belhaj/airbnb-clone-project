# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This repository will guide you through building a scalable, secure, and maintainable web application, focusing on backend architecture, database design, API development, and CI/CD.

- **Repository Management:** Establish a clean, well-documented GitHub repository following industry best practices.
- **Backend Architecture:** Design and implement a modular Django-based backend with REST and GraphQL APIs.
- **Database Design:** Model a relational database schema in MySQL that captures users, listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.
- **API Security:** Apply authentication, authorization, and data validation to safeguard endpoints and user data.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Configure automated pipelines using GitHub Actions (or equivalent) for testing, linting, and deployment.
- **Team Collaboration:** Document roles, workflows, and code conventions to enable seamless collaboration in a team environment.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python)
- **API Layers:** Django REST Framework & Graphene-Django (GraphQL)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or alternative)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
