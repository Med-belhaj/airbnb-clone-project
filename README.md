# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This repository will guide you through building a scalable, secure, and maintainable web application, focusing on backend architecture, database design, API development, and CI/CD.

## Project Goals
- **Repository Management:** Establish a clean, well-documented GitHub repository following industry best practices.
- **Backend Architecture:** Design and implement a modular Django-based backend with REST and GraphQL APIs.
- **Database Design:** Model a relational database schema in MySQL that captures users, listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.
- **API Security:** Apply authentication, authorization, and data validation to safeguard endpoints and user data.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Configure automated pipelines using GitHub Actions (or equivalent) for testing, linting, and deployment.
- **Team Collaboration:** Document roles, workflows, and code conventions to enable seamless collaboration in a team environment.

## Team Roles
- **Project Manager:** Oversees project timeline, coordinates between stakeholders, and ensures milestones are met.
- **Backend Developer:** Implements server-side logic using Django, develops REST and GraphQL APIs, and handles business logic.
- **Database Administrator:** Designs and maintains the MySQL database schema, ensures data integrity, manages migrations, and optimizes queries.
- **Frontend Developer:** (When applicable) Integrates with API endpoints, implements UI components, and ensures responsive design.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Configures Docker containers, sets up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and manages deployment processes.
- **Security Engineer:** Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms, audits code for vulnerabilities, and enforces best security practices.
- **QA Engineer:** Writes and executes test cases, performs automated and manual testing, and ensures application quality.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python)
- **API Layers:** Django REST Framework & Graphene-Django (GraphQL)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or alternative)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
